# sol-rs â˜€

`sol-rs` is a small rendering toolkit for Vulkan, with a focus on real-time raytracing (which is not currently available via other APIs such as WebGPU). It hosts convenience wrappers but also exposes [ash](https://github.com/MaikKlein/ash) directly. Tested on Windows/NVIDIA, but the non-raytracing samples also work on Mac via MoltenVK.

However, this remains a personal sandbox for learning and experimentation so use at your own risk!

## Requirements
[LunarG Vulkan SDK](https://lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/) installation.

On Windows, setting a `VULKAN_SDK` environment variable to the 1.3.204.1 SDK installation folder should prevent the need for building shaderc from source. Otherwise, additional installations such as [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) may be required. Please refer to the following [instructions](https://github.com/google/shaderc-rs/blob/master/README.md) if you run into shaderc-related issues.
